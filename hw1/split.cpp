/*
CSCI 104: Homework 1 Problem 1

Write a recursive function to split a sorted singly-linked
list into two sorted linked lists, where one has the even 
numbers and the other contains the odd numbers. Students 
will receive no credit for non-recursive solutions. 
**Do NOT add main() to this file**.

To test your program write a separate .cpp file and #include
split.h, but do not submit it.  When you submit, the function
below should be the only one in this file.
*/

#include "split.h"

/* Add a prototype for a helper function here if you need */

void split(Node*& in, Node*& odds, Node*& evens)
{
  /* Add code here */


}

/* If you needed a helper function, write it here */

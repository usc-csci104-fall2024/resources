 *                                                                            *
 * This file defines the libperf interface.  libperf is a library that wraps  *
 * around the syscall sys_perf_event_open( ).  This library exposes the       *
 * kernel performance counters subsystem to userspace code.  It can be used   *
 * to efficiently trace portions of code with kernel support.  Tracing        *
 * individual tasks/pids requires root access (as to some other functional    *
 * components).                                                               *
 *                                                                            *
 * This system call interface was first announced in 2009 by Ingo Molnar      *
 * (http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/6/6/149), and is now included in the Linux      *
 * kernel mainline.                                                           *
 *                                                                            *
 * Note: libperf is thread safe.  Multiple threads may use this library, but  *
 * each thread should call libperf_initialize separately and use their own    *
 * context returned from that call for subsequent library calls.              *
 *                                                                            *
